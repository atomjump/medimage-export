# MedImage export capability. Alpha. 

This is an alternative interface to the MedImage app, which allows you to take a photo from inside AtomJump Messenger, or select a photo, and have it sent through to a medical desktop system via the MedImage Server. It uses a textual chatbot-style interface.

For a simple installation, we recommend using the AtomJump Appliance. See "Installation with the AtomJump Appliance" below. Otherwise, please follow these steps:

1. Get the project into your plugins folder

```
cd plugins
git clone https://github.com/atomjump/medimage_export.git
```

2. You should copy the config/configORIGINAL.json to plugins/medimage_export/config/config.json, and edit the entries with your own server paths.

3. You must open up the temporary folder plugins/medimage_export/temp/, at present.

```
sudo chmod 777 plugins/medimage_export/temp
``` 

4. Add "medimage_export" to your loop-server config/config.json file's plugins array. e.g.

```
"plugins" : [
	...
	"otherplugin",
	"medimages_export"
]
```


We only recommend you install this software for evaluation / interest levels, and __not in a production environment__, at this stage. More careful checks are required around security of the 'temp' folder, and whether a file can be left in there under unusual circumstances.


## Installation with the AtomJump Appliance

See the AtomJump Messaging Appliance at: http://atomjump.org/wp/atomjump-messaging-appliance/

From the command-line, after having logged in, enter:

```
eval "$(curl -fsSL -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' https://raw.githubusercontent.com/atomjump/medimage_export/master/install)"
```

Then, click the following link to run a one-time update of your database:
* http://127.0.0.1:5100/vendor/atomjump/loop-server/update-indexes.php
* [or using your own IP address at http://__myipaddress__:5100/vendor/atomjump/loop-server/update-indexes.php]








## Future work

* The plugin does not currently allow full-size photos (they are around 1200 pixels). You can, however, extend the size of the hi-res photos in your AtomJump Messenger config.json file. In future, we would likely want to run this as a secondary background process.

* Feedback on a successful upload only goes so far as telling you it is on the proxy server, and doesn't tell you if it has reached your target destination. See the upload.php file for further things to do here.

* It probably needs better reminders about changing the patient id when you first come back into the app.

* Multi-language support and a language file.

* See http://medimage.co.nz/building-an-alternative-client-to-medimage/ for notes on MedImage client installation when extending this app.

* More careful checks are required around security of the temp folder, and whether a file can be left in there.

* Because photos can be vertically oriented from this interface, some MedImage add-on tools, such as Wound Mapp, may not handle the orientation correctly, and appear to stretch photos.

* A group .pdf export, and individual existing photos within the group are yet to be completed.

* This pairs on an individual browser basis, but we could support a system-wide pairing.
